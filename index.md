## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/vcollapsar/DEO/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

TDEO (Discs with Embedded Objects) is a new one dimensional code to model viscous disc plus dust and embeddedplanet or star objects. It is offered as (1) an alternative to 2D/3D codes when their intended application is beyonduser’s numerical resources; (2) as an inner boundary condition for such codes; (3) a method to setup initial conditionsfor multi-D simulations. Here we summarise physical assumptions, equations, and provide sample applications of thecode.
